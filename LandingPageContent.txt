Hridhyanam is an attempt to empower the medical industry with the prowess of Computer Vision. India is a country of 1.32 billion people and less than a 10,000 radiologists and the huge doctor-patient ratio discrepancy between the rural and urban areas doesn't help the  issue.
At Hridhyanam, we hope to reduce this issue by empowering the technician to screen for diseases by uploading the medical images. As a proof of concept  we have diagnosed a Cardiomegaly by processing the Chest Xrays. We aim to form an alliance between the analytical expertise of the man and the computing capabilities of the machine for these two, if coalesced, can truly provide healthcare and, in turn, heartcare at its best.
